      "body": "<h2>Our opinion</h2> <p> Kotlin has a very simplified syntax, making the programmer write less code to do the same thing compared to its peer languages used in the corporate world like C# or Java. It is worth noting that other languages are also adapting and adhering to the same characteristic. Also, Kotlin has an easy learning curve for those coming from Java. We conclude that Kotlin can be a good option to accelerate developer productivity in new projects. If deadline is a critical variable for project success, consider Kotlin. </p> <p> One factor that might make you rethink choosing Kotlin is whether the application will have a critical performance requirement. Kotlin has a runtime resource usage overhead that can be a disadvantage in this scenario, favoring other languages. Another factor that can be important is the slow build time, impacting the execution time of pipelines, for example. </p> <p> The factors that led to the above opinion can be seen in this <a target='__blank' href='https://github.com/db1group/common-api-benchmarks'>benchmark</a> . </p> <p> Despite the characteristics above, there are important factors such as: availability of qualified labor in the market, learning curve of the existing team. </p> <h2>Why</h2> <p> Kotlin is a programming language that was first introduced by JetBrains, the company behind the popular IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Java, in 2011. It is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as well as on other platforms such as Android, JavaScript, and Native. </p> <p> Kotlin was designed to address some of the shortcomings of Java and to provide a more modern and expressive language for building complex software systems. It has a more concise syntax than Java, which reduces boilerplate code and makes it easier to read and write. It also supports functional programming concepts, such as higher-order functions and lambdas, which make it easier to write code that is both concise and expressive. </p> <p> One of Kotlin's main selling points is its interoperability with Java. Kotlin code can easily call Java code, and vice versa, which makes it a great choice for teams that want to integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects. Additionally, Kotlin has become the preferred language for developing Android apps, thanks in part to its improved syntax and features that make it easier to write concise, maintainable code. </p> <p> There are many benefits to using Kotlin as a programming language. Here are a few: </p> <ol> <li> <p> <strong>Concise syntax</strong>: Kotlin's concise syntax makes it easier to write and read code, reducing boilerplate and making it faster to develop and maintain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Null-safety</strong>: Kotlin's type system helps prevent null pointer exceptions, which can be a common source of bugs in Java programs. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin was designed to be fully interoperable with Java, which means that Kotlin code can easily call Java code and vice versa. This makes it easy to integrate Kotlin into existing Java projects. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Improved type inference</strong>: Kotlin has a powerful type inference system that can help reduce the amount of explicit type declarations needed in code. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Functional programming support</strong>: Kotlin supports many functional programming concepts, such as higher-order functions and lambdas, which can make code more concise and expressive. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Extension functions</strong>: Kotlin allows developers to add new functionality to existing classes without having to create new subclasses or modify the original class. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Coroutines</strong>: Kotlin has built-in support for coroutines, which can make it easier to write asynchronous code that is both efficient and easy to read. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Android support</strong>: Kotlin has become the preferred language for developing Android apps, thanks to its improved syntax and features that make it easier to write concise, maintainable code. </p> </li> </ol> <p> While Kotlin has many benefits as a programming language, there are also some potential downsides or limitations to consider. Here are a few: </p> <ol> <li> <p> <strong>Learning curve</strong>: If you're already familiar with Java or another programming language, there may be a learning curve when switching to Kotlin. Although Kotlin has a relatively easy-to-learn syntax, it also introduces some new concepts that may take some time to understand. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Build times</strong>: Some developers have reported longer build times when using Kotlin compared to Java. This is due to the fact that Kotlin's syntax requires more processing time than Java's, especially when dealing with lambdas and other functional programming constructs. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>IDE support</strong>: While Kotlin has good IDE support in IntelliJ IDEA, which was created by the same team that developed Kotlin, support for other IDEs may be less robust. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Runtime overhead</strong>: Kotlin introduces some additional runtime overhead due to features like null safety and other safety checks. While this overhead is generally minimal, it may be a consideration in performance-critical applications. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Limited adoption in some areas</strong>: While Kotlin has gained significant popularity in the Android development community, it is still less widely adopted in other areas such as enterprise web development or scientific computing. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong>Limited community support</strong>: While the Kotlin community is growing rapidly, it is still smaller than the Java community and may have less resources and support available in certain areas. </p> </li> </ol> <p> It's worth noting that these potential downsides may not be significant concerns for all projects or developers, and the benefits of using Kotlin may outweigh any limitations for many use cases. </p>"
